In this thesis, Bayesian Convolutional Neural Network (BayesCNN) is proposed and is applied to many computer vision tasks like Image Classification, Image Super Resolution and Generative Adversarial Networks. BayesCNN is based on Bayes by Backprop and it is demonstrated how this novel reliable variational inference method can serve as a fundamental construct for various network architectures (AlexNet, LeNet, 3Conv3FC). The results are compared to the frequentist inference in identical architectures on multiple datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, STL-10, BSD300) and a comparison between the results is drawn.
