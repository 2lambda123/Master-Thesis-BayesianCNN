\begin{acknowledgements}      

I would first like to thank my thesis advisor Prof. Marcus Liwicki who was always present physically or virtually whenever I ran into some trouble or had a crazy thought. He consistently steered me in the right the direction whenever he thought I needed it.

I would also like to thank my second thesis advisor Felix Laumann with whom I worked in Copenhagen and in Kaiserslautern. He also made sure Imperial College, London is never far away with our continuous calls and discussion. He assisted in all different work done in the thesis from research to implementation and writing.

I would also like to acknowledge University of Kaiserlautern for providing me the opportunity for writing the thesis and MindGarage for providing me the computation power.

I must express my very profound gratitude to my parents (Vivek and Anita), to my sister (Mineshi) and to Purvanshi Mehta for providing me with unfailing support and continuous encouragement throughout thesis. 

Finally, I am thankful to Ashutosh Mishra, Saurabh Varshneya and Ayushman Dash for their invaluable comments and endless discussion. I am also thankful to Sadique Adnan Siddiqui for his late night tea and delicious food. This accomplishment would not have been possible without them. 

Thank you.

Kumar Shridhar
